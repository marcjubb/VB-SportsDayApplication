My A grade A-Level coursework using Visual Basic 2010.

This project was completed in full in the program aspect, although due to COVID-19 the documentation write up was not completed.
The program itself recieved an A grade.

The program includes SQL, object orientation progamming, HTML, inheritance and many more aspects of my coding.

The whole program is writen by myself and no one else.
